https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture?id=repository

The repository layer is a wrapper around one or more data providers with which the Bloc Layer communicates.

As you can see, our repository layer can interact with multiple data providers and perform transformations on the data before handing the result to the business logic Layer.
